# minimisation-algorithms
Mathematical methods for finding the local or global minima of a function:
1. One Dimensional Minimisation
    - [x] Least squares methods
    - [x] Parabolic method
2. Multi-Dimensional Minimisation
    - [ ] Univariate method (extension of the one dimensional parabolic method)
    - [ ] Gradient descent
    - [ ] Newton's method
    - [ ] Quasi-Newton method
    - [ ] Monte Carlo minimisation (Simulated Annealing)
